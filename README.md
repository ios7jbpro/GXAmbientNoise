# GXAmbientNoise
Replicating the background sounds

Ever wanted the Opera GX's ambient sounds but not the browser itself? Well you're in the right place, this Python script exactly does that with configurations as well.

# Configurations
"path" can point to a single mp3 file, or a path with multiple mp3 files named 1,2,3... as much as you want. But **it has to be named numerically**. It won't work otherwise.

"volume" changes the volume level.

# Keybinds

They work globally, modifier key is CTRL+ALT+Shift.

mod+Q for the previous track

mod+E for the next track

mod+W to mute/unmute the audio playback
